**Strategic Social Media and SEO Plan for Dadri Forecast**

Dadri Forecast is a research collective documenting land issues, environmental degradation, caste/communal conflict, and extractivism in Dadri (Uttar Pradesh).

**Instagram Strategy (Mind Map of Content and Tactics)**

- **Content Themes:** Develop posts around *Education*, *Activism*, *Art & Culture*, and *Community Stories*. For example:
  
  - *Educational:* Factsheets on Dadri's land rights issues, caste history, and ecological data.
  
  - *Movement Updates:* Photos/videos from protests, field visits or meetings; infographics on local research findings.
  
  - *Art & Culture:* Showcase children's artworks from Khandera Art
    Space and local murals, linking visuals to themes of justice and
    ecology.
  
  - *People & Interviews:* Portraits and quotes of farmers,
    students, artists and academics in Dadri discussing their
    experiences.

- **Post Formats:** Use a mix of Instagram media types to maximize
  reach and engagement:
  
  - **Reels (Short Videos):** High-engagement video clips (0.62%
    avg. engagement). Example: quick explainers of caste-environment
    issues, behind-the-scenes of fieldwork, or poet/artist readings.
    Reels should be visually striking and mobile-friendly.
  
  - **Carousels (Multi-Image Slides):** Multi-frame "slideshow"
    posts for educational content, modeled on activist infographics.
    For instance, a 5--10 slide carousel can explain *"What is
    extractivism?"* or *"Ambedkar on land reform"* with bold text
    and images. Activist groups have popularized Instagram carousels
    ("PowerPoint activism") to educate audiences one slide at a
    time.
  
  - **Stories & Highlights:** Use Stories for timely updates (e.g.,
    live event coverage, quick polls, Q&A sessions) and save key
    topics as Highlight albums (with custom icons) to introduce
    projects (e.g. **"Art"**, **"Events"**, **"FAQs"**).
    Well-designed story covers (as recommended in social media
    best-practices) can make the profile look polished.
  
  - **Live/IGTV Sessions:** Host live discussions or longer
    interview segments on IGTV with scholars and activists. Promote
    these in advance in Stories and posts.

- **Engagement Tactics:**
  
  - **Interactive Features:** Use Instagram's interactive stickers
    (polls, Q&As, quizzes) in Stories to ask followers' opinions
    (e.g. *"Which local issue concerns you most?"*) and respond to
    their input. This fosters two-way communication.
  
  - **Hashtag Campaigns:** Create campaign-specific hashtags (e.g.
    **#DadriForecast**, **#दादरीपूर्वांचल**) and encourage followers to
    use them. Run contests or challenges (e.g. an art contest using
    a #DadriArt tag) to generate User-Generated Content. Inviting
    followers to share their own photos or stories (UGC) makes the
    project participatory and relatable.
  
  - **Collaborations & Tagging:** Partner with allied organizations,
    local NGOs or artist collectives. Co-host Instagram Live
    sessions or feature guest posts. Always tag collaborators and
    sponsors in posts -- this notifies them and can lead to reposts,
    expanding reach.
  
  - **Frequency & Visual Quality:** Aim to post consistently (e.g.
    3--5 times weekly) with high-quality, eye-catching visuals.
    Caption each post with clear, engaging text that reflects the
    project's mission. Use emojis sparingly to draw attention and
    break text. According to nonprofit Instagram guidance,
    well-written captions with strategic hashtags yield higher
    engagement.

**SEO Roadmap (Ambedkarite/Marxist Perspective)**

*Figure: Example SEO strategy flow -- audience research, content
planning, on-page and off-page optimization (from nonprofit SEO
best-practices).*

- **Audience & Keyword Research:** Identify your target audiences
  (local residents, scholars, activists) and the phrases they search.
  Use a mix of place-based terms ("Dadri Uttar Pradesh"), issue terms
  ("caste land rights", "environmental injustice" in Hindi/English),
  and ideological terms ("Ambedkarite critique", "dalit ecology",
  "class struggle India"). For example, combine local context with
  Ambedkarite/Marxist framing: "दलित भूमि अधिकार" or "caste-class
  struggle India." Start SEO with audience and keyword planning as
  recommended in nonprofit guides.

- **Content Creation Plan:** Publish website articles, blog posts and
  reports using those keywords. Each piece should educate readers on
  our themes (land, caste, extractivism) from an Ambedkarite/Marxist
  viewpoint. Ensure primary keywords appear in page titles, headings,
  URL slugs and image alt-text. For example, an article titled *"How
  Dadri's Landowners Exploit Dalit Labor"* uses both location and
  caste-class terms.

- **On-Page Optimization:** Structure each page for SEO. Use
  descriptive titles/meta descriptions (e.g. "DadriForecast -- Land
  Rights & Caste in Dadri"), and format content with H1/H2 headings
  containing target keywords. Tag all images (e.g. "Khandera child
  painting Dalit liberation") and include captions in Hindi or English
  as appropriate. Follow basic SEO hygiene (fast loading pages,
  mobile-friendly design).

- **Off-Page SEO -- Link Building:** Build backlinks by collaborating
  with aligned sites. Write op-eds or summaries for sympathetic
  platforms (academic journals, Ambedkarite collectives, environmental
  blogs) that link back to DadriForecast. Reach out to universities
  and NGOs for press releases about field events. Partnerships with
  local groups (NGOs, art collectives) not only boost local
  credibility but also create shareable links.

- **Technical & Local SEO:** Ensure the website is registered with
  Google Search Console and has an XML sitemap. Use schema markup
  (e.g. *Organization*, *Event*) for site credibility. Since local
  audiences are key, include a Google Map on your site and mention
  "Dadri, Uttar Pradesh" in contact info for geotargeting. Also
  consider Google Ad Grants (if eligible) to run ad campaigns for
  Hindi-English queries about caste/environment (though organic SEO is
  primary).

- **Monitor & Adapt:** Regularly check analytics for traffic trends.
  Which keywords drive visits? Which pages retain readers? Use that
  data to refine content. For example, if "Dadri protest" is a common
  search, produce more content around protests. Continually update old
  posts with new data. The nonprofit SEO cycle (audience research →
  content improvement → off-page SEO → monitoring) should be repeated
  to grow reach over time.

**Content Series Ideas**

- **"Faces of Dadri" (Photo Stories):** A weekly series featuring
  portraits of local residents, activists or students with quotes
  about how land and caste issues affect them. Combine each photo with
  a brief text story (bilingual if possible) on Instagram.

- **Children's Art Showcase:** Regular posts highlighting artwork from
  Khandera Art Space's children, accompanied by the child's name/age
  and a short message (e.g., "This drawing is about equality"). Tag
  the young artists (with guardians' permission) and art teachers.
  This series humanizes the issue and encourages community pride.

- **Expert Interviews:** Record short video interviews or quote cards
  with academics and activists (e.g. local professors, Dalit rights
  leaders). For example, a reel or IGTV session with an Ambedkarite
  scholar explaining "caste and climate change" can bridge academic
  and Instagram audiences. Promote these segments as part of a series
  (e.g. **"Dadri Dialogues"**).

- **Explainer Carousels:** Create multi-slide posts that break down
  complex topics. Examples: *"Caste & Land in 5 Slides"* or
  *"Understanding Extractivism."* Use clear graphics and bullet
  points. As Vox notes, activists have popularized these Instagram
  "slideshows" to educate followers one image at a time. Ensure to use
  the carousel format and encourage swiping.

- **Community Voices (UGC):** Invite followers to contribute content.
  For instance, launch a hashtag like #MyDadriStory where villagers
  upload their own photos or short videos. Curate and repost selected
  entries (with credit). This user-generated series builds engagement
  and trust.

- **Event Coverage:** Whenever there's a rally, workshop or cultural
  event (e.g. Ambedkar Jayanti program), post highlights: photo
  collages of the event, quotes from speakers, and summaries. Tag
  event partners and geotag the location. Turning events into
  mini-series (e.g. "DadriForecast @ Farmers' March -- Jan '25") keeps
  the page dynamic.

**Increasing Visibility & Outreach**

- **Local Partnerships:** Collaborate with local organizations
  (women's groups, farmers' cooperatives, schools) to co-host events
  and share content. Local partners can display flyers, share posts
  with their networks, or feature DadriForecast on community notice
  boards. As nonprofit guides note, partnerships (even with small
  local businesses or NGOs) broaden visibility and are mutually
  beneficial. For example, ask a local bookstore or cafe to host a
  panel discussion on caste and ecology.

- **Community Events:** Organize grassroots events -- clean-up drives,
  mural-painting days, or film screenings -- that directly involve
  villagers. Such events create "buzz" and often get word-of-mouth
  promotion. For instance, a "Dadri Environment Day" with student art
  displays and nature walks would attract local media coverage and
  Instagram photo ops. Even non-fundraising events (like cultural
  fairs) strengthen community ties.

- **Media & Language:** Pitch stories to local newspapers, Hindi radio
  and TV stations about your findings and events (emphasize human
  interest angles). Publish guest articles in Hindi on popular blogs
  or e-magazines (e.g. Panchjanya, Caravan Hindi) and English journals
  (Economic & Political Weekly). Being bilingual is key: use Hindi
  subtitles or posts in Devnagari for Hindi-speaking followers.

- **Academic & Intellectual Outreach:** Engage national/international
  scholars by tagging them on Twitter or emailing them reports. Share
  posts using academic conferences/communities hashtags (e.g. #SCWESC,
  #DalitStudies). Encourage faculty from Ambedkarite colleges or
  progressive universities to repost content. Collaborate with
  think-tanks or universities (e.g. JNU, MCRC Pune) by co-hosting
  webinars -- this puts DadriForecast on scholarly radars.

- **Digital Campaigns:** Time content with broader campaigns (e.g.
  #WorldEnvironmentDay, #CasteEquityDay, or #AmbedkarJayanti) to be
  part of larger conversations. Use trending hashtags related to
  social justice (#ClimateJustice, #SocialismIndia) to reach
  like-minded global audiences. Also consider Facebook or Twitter to
  repost key findings, linking back to Instagram and the website.

- **Leverage Diaspora Networks:** Share Dadri stories on platforms
  like Diaspora Candle, and tag global Indian social justice groups.
  International human-rights orgs and academic networks (AMED:
  Ambedkar Media Center, etc.) may amplify your content.

**Instagram Profile Strategy: Bio, Handle, Hashtags & Collaborations**

- **Handle & Bio:** Choose a clear Instagram handle (e.g.
  **\@DadriForecast**). In the bio (150-character limit), succinctly
  describe the mission in English and include Hindi keywords. For
  example: "Research on land, caste & environment in Dadri.
  Ambedkarite/Marxist lens. #DadriForecast". Use an emoji or two (e.g.
  🔍🌾📚) for visual appeal. As recommended for nonprofits, draw
  attention with emojis and key hashtags in the bio. Mark the profile
  category as "Nonprofit Organization" and add contact info or a
  website link. If relevant, include a short Hindi phrase or hashtag
  (e.g. #भूमिहक) to signal local relevance.

- **Story Highlights:** Create custom icons for Story Highlight covers
  (e.g. a book icon for "Insights", an art palette for "Art", a mic
  for "Talks"). This makes the profile inviting and helps new visitors
  find flagship content (e.g., pin a "About Us" highlight explaining
  DadriForecast's goals).

- **Hashtag Strategy:** Use 3--5 relevant hashtags per post. Mix a
  unique campaign tag (e.g. #DadriForecast) with targeted tags like
  **#DalitRights, #LandRights, #ClimateJustice, #SocialJusticeIndia,
  #CasteEquity, #जलवायु**, etc. Avoid generic tags (#green, #happy)
  which dilute focus. Include location tags (#Dadri, #उत्तर_प्रदेश) and
  cause tags in Hindi (#दलित, #भूमिहक) to reach both local and thematic
  audiences. As one guide suggests, pairing an organizational hashtag
  with trending campaign hashtags boosts exposure. Always write a
  clear caption reflecting DadriForecast's message -- a well-crafted
  caption plus relevant hashtags improves engagement.

- **Collaborations & Tagging:** Proactively tag partner orgs, artists
  and funders in posts. For example, when sharing a child's artwork
  from Khandera Art Space, tag \@khandera_art (if available). Tag
  scholarly co-authors or influencers when quoting them. Collaborating
  accounts are alerted and often reshare content, widening reach.
  Consider co-hosting Instagram Lives with allied accounts (e.g.
  environmental NGOs, Dalit collectives) -- this cross-pollinates
  followers. If funding allows, use Instagram's paid promotion to
  boost key posts (targeting interests like "Social Issues",
  "Sustainable Agriculture").
